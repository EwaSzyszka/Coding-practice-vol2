What is the expected number of correct matches that the medium will make (by chance)? --> 1

Given that we have 19.3% chance of getting at a match and each round we have 5 matches
we will have 5 * 0.193 = 0.958 %. Thus the most likely number of matches is one.

What is the probability that the medium will obtain at least 1 correct match?
    
P(at least 1 hit) = P(1hit) + P(2hit) + P(3hit) + P(4hit) + P(5hit)
P(no match) + P(at least 1 hit) = P(1hit) + P(2hit) + P(3hit) + P(4hit) + P(5hit) = 1
P(at least 1 hit) = P(1hit) + P(2hit) + P(3hit) + P(4hit) + P(5hit) = 1 - P(no match)


Sally is new to the area and listens to some friends discussing about another female friend.
Sally knows that they are talking about either Alice or Bella but doesn’t know which. From previous conversations
Sally knows some independent pieces of information: She’s 90% sure that Alice has a white car, but
doesn’t know if Bella’s car is white or black. Similarly, she’s 90% sure that Bella likes sushi, but doesn’t know
if Alice likes sushi. Sally hears from the conversation that the person being discussed hates sushi and drives
a white car. What is the probability that the friends are talking about Alice? Assume maximal uncertainty @@
in the absence of any knowledge of the probabilities.



A - Alice
B - Bella
W - white car

P(Alice) = 0.5
P(Bella) = 0.5

P(W|Alice) = 0.9
P(B|Alice) = 0.1

P(W|Bella) = 0.5
P(B|Bella) = 0.5

P(S|Bella) = 0.9
P(-S|Bella) = 0.1

P(S|Alice) = 0.5
P(S|Alice) = 0.5 


P(Alice| -S, W) = ?






P(|W) = 0.9
P(B|S) = 0.9

hates sushi and drives white car 

P(A) = ?

p(Alice|car=white,sushi=false)
